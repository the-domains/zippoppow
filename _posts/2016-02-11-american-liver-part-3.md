# american liver, part 3

Truckin' down to San Fran,  
The Wills curving another roller  
ducks from the hot wind and the olive trees.  
He carried most of the conversation  
between silent reverence for The Byrds  
and wavering recollections of tambourine men.  
SF looming at that point like a large exchange routine  
googled with a googol operations within  
its own reasons and collective wariness.  
The fascinated are there,  
the sons and daughters of ancient Rome and Greece,  
as if finally collected,  
in a fantastic and cosmic display of attraction,  
into one of the final outposts  
at the edge of the western world.
