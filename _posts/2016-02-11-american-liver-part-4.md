# american liver, part 4

I can feel the burnout coming,  
rising like black kittens  
bounding across a field of timothy hay,  
emerging and rising upon the curving horizon  
angling in stop-animated edges  
splintering into black inky hashes  
at the corners of the pages  
black until the border edge  
bears an abrupt reprieve until  
the appearances of the page give way  
to the airy afterthoughts of consciousness and shadow.  
The Wills, with hands bearing down the dashboard, grins.  
"The pain of living is that there's not enough of it!"  
We're hoping madly for a Peet's Coffee.  
I drive on. The Wills drives on.
