            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>american liver, part 1</h1><p>so, i wake up in the middle of nothing-but-starlights-and-waves and wonder copiously for the matter of minutes …. huh, these days it’s minutes, never hours … smiling, i rise and speculate real quick for butter and some sort of suggested resonance with those others of namelessness and wonders percolating in the aetheric coast of my understanding that elsewhere they are as non-distracted by the smarter devices as I could be given other choices.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>american liver, part 4</h1><p>I can feel the burnout coming,
rising like black kittens
bounding across a field of timothy hay,
emerging and rising upon the curving horizon
angling in stop-animated edges
splintering into black inky hashes
at the corners of the pages
black until the border edge
bears an abrupt reprieve until
the appearances of the page give way
to the airy afterthoughts of consciousness and shadow.

The Wills, with hands bearing down the dashboard, grins.

“The pain of living is that there’s not enough of it!”

We’re hoping madly for a Peet’s Coffee.

I drive on. The Wills drives on.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>american liver, part 3</h1><p>Truckin’ down to San Fran,
The Wills curving another roller
ducks from the hot wind and the olive trees.

He carried most of the conversation
between silent reverence for The Byrds
and wavering recollections of tambourine men.

SF looming at that point like a large exchange routine
googled with a googol operations within
its own reasons and collective wariness.

The fascinated are there,
the sons and daughters of ancient Rome and Greece,
as if finally collected,
in a fantastic and cosmic display of attraction,
into one of the final outposts
at the edge of the western world.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>american liver, part 2</h1><p>I found myself serially disposed in the middle of a bold mandala, a spicy rendition of old bones zapped with the wine spodiody coursing of blood and a heart so big it holds the melody together in anticipation of the right configuration of space and musical note to lift the heart into the warm embrace of life itself… old bones… such a diminutive way of honoring the well-lived, the long-lived.

I cried. I did. I wept and stifled. I cried.
I spent time with a great mandala in my hand presenting kaleidoscopic resonance to the tender melodies and fierce hearts collected for an afternoon in the cafeteria of the retirement home.

There, life as much as anywhere.

It’s the wallpaper that mocks. It’s the wallpaper. Striped and installed over dry-wall. It’s America. It’s the American dream of convergence, of the convergence of a new moon, a cautious child’s melody and the wonder of a dancing heart taking what it can get for the moment.

I remember the Navy cup and forearm tattoo of the gypsy woman. She didn’t seem to mind; rather, to embrace the large risks lived through…</p></article>]]></description>
